FractalGenerator
================

Simple Swift code for generating Mandelbrot Set image sequences.

This is purely experimental code. When learning a new language, I tend to fall back to the M-Set.
It's like a strange attractor for me ;)

Some of this code is for testing Swift's optimizer. Complex.swift is for that purpose. It makes the
code easier to read also.

Use this code how you like.

Attempt no copyrights.

Use it together. Use it in peace.
